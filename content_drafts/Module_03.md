# Module 3 – Regulatory Capital Structure: CET1, AT1, Tier 2

---

## 3.1 Capital quality hierarchy and “going-concern” vs “gone-concern”

Under Basel III, regulatory capital is structured in **three main layers**:

* **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)** – highest quality capital.
* **Additional Tier 1 (AT1)** – still going-concern capital, but lower quality than CET1.
* **Tier 2** – gone-concern capital.

Grouped by their role:

* **Tier 1 capital (going-concern):**

  * CET1
  * AT1

* **Tier 2 capital (gone-concern):**

  * Eligible Tier 2 instruments and provisions

**Going-concern capital**
Capital that can absorb losses **while the bank is still operating as a going concern**, without automatically triggering insolvency, resolution, or liquidation. Under Basel III, this is **Tier 1 (CET1 + AT1)**.

**Gone-concern capital**
Capital that mainly absorbs losses **once the bank has failed** and is in liquidation or resolution. This is **Tier 2**.

Basel III also requires that **AT1 and Tier 2 instruments** include features that allow them to absorb losses at the **Point of Non-Viability (PoNV)**—for example, mandatory conversion into equity or write-down when the supervisor determines that the bank would otherwise fail or needs public support.

## 3.2 Basel III capital structure and minimum ratios

### 3.2.1 Global Basel structure

At Basel III level, the components are:

* **CET1**

  * Common shares that meet strict CET1 criteria
  * Share premium (stock surplus) on those shares
  * Retained earnings
  * Other reserves and accumulated other comprehensive income that are freely available
  * Eligible minority interest in the common equity of consolidated subsidiaries
  * **Less: CET1 regulatory adjustments** (intangible assets, certain DTAs, investments in other financial institutions, etc.)

* **AT1**

  * Qualifying AT1 instruments (that are not CET1)
  * Associated share premium
  * Eligible AT1 instruments issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties
  * **Less: AT1-specific regulatory adjustments**

* **Tier 2**

  * Qualifying Tier 2 debt and preference instruments
  * Associated share premium
  * Eligible Tier 2 instruments issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties
  * Certain **loan-loss provisions / general provisions** subject to caps
  * **Less: Tier 2-specific regulatory adjustments**

Aggregations:

[
\text{Tier 1 Capital} = \text{CET1} + \text{AT1}
]

[
\text{Total Capital} = \text{Tier 1} + \text{Tier 2}
]

**Basel III (global template) minimum ratios (before buffers):**

* CET1 ratio ≥ **4.5%** of RWA
* Tier 1 ratio ≥ **6.0%** of RWA
* Total capital ratio ≥ **8.0%** of RWA

On top of this, Basel III prescribes buffers (capital conservation buffer and counter-cyclical buffer) to be held in **CET1**.

### 3.2.2 India (RBI) – capital stack and minima

RBI adopts the same **CET1 / AT1 / Tier 2** stack but with **stricter minimum ratios** for banks.

On a fully-implemented basis (for scheduled commercial banks):

| Requirement                        | % of RWA (India – typical Basel III banks) |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Minimum CET1                       | **5.5%**                                   |
| Capital Conservation Buffer (CET1) | **2.5%**                                   |
| **CET1 incl. CCB**                 | **8.0%**                                   |
| Minimum Tier 1 (CET1 + AT1)        | **7.0%**                                   |
| Minimum Total Capital (CRAR)       | **9.0%**                                   |
| **Total Capital incl. CCB**        | **11.5%**                                  |

RBI guidelines and IIBF training material also present this as:

* Within the **9%** minimum CRAR, **Tier 1** is expected to be the dominant part, and
* Tier 2 has practical caps relative to Tier 1 (for some entities and legacy frameworks).

For practical purposes, an Indian bank is usually expected to operate **comfortably above 11.5%** total capital ratio under normal conditions.

## 3.3 CET1 – components, deductions and structure

### 3.3.1 Role of CET1

**Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)** is the **highest-quality capital** in the Basel framework. It is designed to absorb losses **immediately and fully**, without needing any contractual trigger, and without creating legal claims on the bank.

Key characteristics:

* Permanently available to the bank
* Fully loss-absorbing
* Most subordinated in the capital structure (equity holders are paid last)

This is why Basel III insists that **most of a bank’s capital stack must be CET1**.

### 3.3.2 Basel III CET1 – high-level definition

The Basel III definition of CET1 (simplified) is:

**Positive CET1 components:**

* Common shares (or equivalent instruments for non-joint stock banks) meeting strict eligibility criteria
* Share premium (stock surplus) on those common shares
* Retained earnings (audited)
* Other disclosed reserves and accumulated other comprehensive income that are freely available
* Eligible minority interests in CET1 of consolidated banking subsidiaries

**Less, CET1 regulatory adjustments:**

* Goodwill and other intangible assets (net of related deferred tax liabilities)
* Certain **deferred tax assets (DTAs)** that rely on future profitability, subject to **10% and 15% threshold** rules (at the consolidated level, for specified items)
* Significant and non-significant investments in the capital of other financial institutions, above thresholds
* Shortfall of provisions to expected loss (for IRB banks)
* Other prudential filters (e.g. certain unrealised gains, cash flow hedge reserves, pension assets), depending on national implementation

Conceptual formula:

[
\text{CET1} = \text{(CET1 instruments and reserves)} ;-; \text{(CET1 regulatory adjustments)}
]

### 3.3.3 CET1 components – India (RBI / Indian banks)

RBI’s Basel III regulations and IIBF material set out the CET1 components for Indian banks.

**Positive CET1 elements (India – simplified list):**

1. **Paid-up equity share capital** that meets Basel/RBI criteria for common shares.
2. **Share premium** related to qualifying common shares.
3. **Statutory reserves** (such as the reserve fund under the Banking Regulation Act).
4. **Capital reserves** arising from sale of assets (not revaluation reserves).
5. **Other disclosed free reserves** that are genuinely available to absorb losses.
6. **Retained earnings / balance in the Profit & Loss account** at the previous year-end.
7. **Portion of current-year profits**, subject to conditions (e.g. verification, consistent profitability, and deduction of proposed dividends / tax) as specified by RBI.
8. **Eligible minority interest** in common equity of consolidated banking subsidiaries.

**Less, India-specific CET1 regulatory adjustments:**

* Goodwill and other intangible assets
* DTAs and specified investments in financial sector entities in line with Basel threshold rules
* Shortfall of provisions to expected loss (for IRB banks, if applicable)
* Other filters specified in RBI’s Basel III circular (e.g. certain unrealised gains and reserves)

Conceptually, for an Indian bank:

[
\text{CET1}_{\text{India}} = \text{Equity Capital} + \text{(Eligible Reserves)} + \text{Retained Profits} + \text{Eligible Minority Interest} - \text{(Regulatory Adjustments)}
]

A real-world implementation will follow the **exact line items and adjustments** in RBI’s Basel III capital regulations.

---

## 3.4 Additional Tier 1 (AT1) – role, instruments and criteria

### 3.4.1 Conceptual role

**Additional Tier 1 (AT1)** is still **going-concern capital**, but sits **below CET1 in quality**. Instruments are usually **hybrid securities**:

* They often pay coupons like debt,
* But they are designed to absorb losses **before** depositors and senior creditors, through **conversion or write-down** when triggers are hit or at PoNV.

### 3.4.2 Basel AT1 components

Under Basel III, AT1 consists of:

* Eligible AT1 instruments issued by the bank (that are *not* CET1)
* Associated share premium
* Eligible AT1 instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries and held by third parties
* Less: AT1-specific regulatory adjustments

### 3.4.3 Basel AT1 – key eligibility criteria (simplified)

The main Basel III entry criteria for AT1 instruments can be summarised as follows:

1. **Issued and fully paid-in**
2. **Subordinated** to depositors, general creditors, and senior subordinated debt
3. **Perpetual** – no contractual maturity
4. **No step-ups or incentives to redeem** (e.g. no large coupon increases at call dates)
5. **Callable only** after at least 5 years and only with:

   * Prior supervisory approval, and
   * Either replacement with capital of equal or better quality, or demonstration that capital will remain well above regulatory minima after call
6. **Fully discretionary coupons / dividends**:

   * Bank must be able to cancel distributions at any time, for any reason
   * Cancellation is not an event of default
   * Cancelled payments are **non-cumulative**
7. No **credit-sensitive** coupon features (coupon cannot link directly to the institution’s own credit spread)
8. If structured as liabilities, they must include **principal loss-absorption** (conversion to CET1 or write-down) when a pre-specified trigger is breached, in addition to PoNV loss-absorption
9. Instruments must **not be funded or purchased by the bank itself** (directly or indirectly)

These criteria ensure that AT1 behaves like **capital in stress**, not like ordinary senior debt.

### 3.4.4 AT1 in India (RBI flavour)

For Indian banks, RBI’s Basel III regulations specify the types of instruments that can count as AT1.

Typical AT1 elements include:

1. **Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS)** that meet Basel/RBI AT1 criteria.
2. **Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDIs)** (Basel III-compliant AT1 bonds).
3. Share premium related to these instruments.
4. Eligible AT1 instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries and held by third parties.
5. Less: AT1-specific regulatory deductions.

Key Indian features (summarised from RBI/IIBF material):

* Instruments must be **perpetual** and **subordinated**.
* **Coupons are discretionary and non-cumulative**.
* Terms must include **loss-absorption**, either via write-down or conversion, if:

  * CET1 ratio falls below a specified trigger level, and/or
  * The bank reaches **PoNV**, as determined by RBI.

These are the **Basel III-compliant AT1 bonds** that appear in Indian banks’ capital structures and rating reports.

## 3.5 Tier 2 – components, criteria and India specifics

### 3.5.1 Conceptual role

**Tier 2 capital** is primarily **gone-concern capital**.

It is intended to absorb losses **in resolution or liquidation**, once Tier 1 has been exhausted. Instruments can have a **fixed maturity**, and requirements on permanence are less strict than for AT1.

### 3.5.2 Basel Tier 2 – components

Tier 2 includes:

* Qualifying Tier 2 debt instruments (subordinated, long-dated)
* Certain qualifying preference share instruments (where allowed)
* Related share premium
* Eligible Tier 2 instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries and held by third parties
* **General provisions / loan-loss reserves** recognised within limits
* Less: Tier 2-specific regulatory adjustments

### 3.5.3 Basel Tier 2 – key eligibility criteria (simplified)

Main criteria (from Basel III framework) include:

1. **Issued and fully paid-in**

2. **Subordinated** to depositors and general creditors

3. **Unsecured** (no collateral that elevates seniority)

4. **Minimum original maturity of 5 years** for debt instruments

5. **Amortisation in final 5 years** before maturity – the amount recognised in Tier 2 decreases linearly as remaining maturity falls below 5 years:

   If remaining maturity = ( m ) years (with ( 0 < m \le 5 )):

   [
   \text{Recognised Amount} = \text{Nominal} \times \frac{m}{5}
   ]

6. **No step-ups or incentives to redeem**

7. Callable only after 5 years, with supervisory approval and capital replacement / strong capital position

8. No investor right to accelerate repayment except in liquidation/insolvency

9. No credit-sensitive coupons

10. Not funded or purchased by the bank itself

**General provisions / loan-loss reserves** can be recognised in Tier 2 subject to caps:

* Up to **1.25% of credit-risk RWA** for banks using the Standardised Approach
* Up to **0.60% of credit-risk RWA** for IRB banks (excess provisions over expected loss)

### 3.5.4 Tier 2 in India (RBI rules)

RBI’s Basel III capital regulations and related circulars apply these ideas in an Indian context.

Typical **Tier 2 elements for Indian banks** (simplified):

1. **General provisions and loss reserves**, not tied to identified losses, for example:

   * General provisions on standard assets
   * Floating provisions (general in nature)
   * Country risk provisions
   * Provisions for unhedged FX exposures
   * Investment Reserve Account
   * Excess provisions arising from sale of NPAs
   * Countercyclical provisioning buffer
     These are recognised in Tier 2 **up to 1.25% of total credit-risk RWA** (and up to 0.6% of credit-risk RWA for certain IRB excess provisions, where applicable).

2. **Tier 2 debt capital instruments**

   * Subordinated debt with minimum 5-year original maturity
   * Recognised on an amortised basis in the last 5 years to maturity
   * Other conditions similar to Basel (no step-ups, limited call options, etc.)

3. **Preference share capital instruments** where allowed as Tier 2

   * E.g. certain redeemable preference shares meeting Tier 2 criteria

4. **Revaluation reserves**

   * Recognised in Tier 2 but only **45% of the revaluation reserve** is counted (i.e. a 55% discount), due to valuation uncertainty.

5. **Share premium** on Tier 2 instruments

6. **Eligible Tier 2 instruments issued by subsidiaries** and held by third parties

7. Less: **Tier 2 regulatory adjustments / deductions** as per RBI rules

Conceptually:

[
\text{Tier 2}_{\text{India}} = \text{Subordinated Debt} + \text{Eligible Preference Shares} + \text{Allowed Provisions} + 0.45 \times \text{Revaluation Reserves} + \text{Eligible Minority Interest} - \text{Tier 2 Adjustments}
]

Actual implementation must follow the detailed lists and caps in the RBI Basel III circulars.

## 3.6 Capital ratios – formulas and India mapping

Let:

* ( C_{\text{CET1}} ) = CET1 capital (after all regulatory adjustments)
* ( C_{\text{AT1}} ) = AT1 capital (net of adjustments)
* ( C_{\text{Tier2}} ) = Tier 2 capital (net of adjustments)

Define:

[
C_{\text{T1}} = C_{\text{CET1}} + C_{\text{AT1}}
]

[
C_{\text{Total}} = C_{\text{T1}} + C_{\text{Tier2}}
]

Let total risk-weighted assets (RWA) be:

[
\text{RWA} = \text{RWA}*{\text{credit}} + \text{RWA}*{\text{market}} + \text{RWA}_{\text{operational}} ; (+; \text{other components, if applicable})
]

Then the **regulatory capital ratios** are:

[
\text{CET1 Ratio} = \frac{C_{\text{CET1}}}{\text{RWA}}
]

[
\text{Tier 1 Ratio} = \frac{C_{\text{T1}}}{\text{RWA}}
]

[
\text{Total Capital Ratio (CRAR)} = \frac{C_{\text{Total}}}{\text{RWA}}
]

**Basel III template minimums (before buffers):**

* CET1 ≥ **4.5%** of RWA
* Tier 1 ≥ **6.0%** of RWA
* Total capital ≥ **8.0%** of RWA

**India (banks – fully implemented Basel III):**

* CET1 ≥ **5.5%** of RWA
* Tier 1 ≥ **7.0%** of RWA
* Total capital ≥ **9.0%** of RWA
* Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) = **2.5%** of RWA, in CET1

So the **effective target stack** in normal conditions is:

* CET1 (minimum + CCB) = **8.0%**
* Total capital (minimum + CCB) = **11.5%**

---

## 3.7 How capital is actually calculated in a bank (process view)

In practice, the regulatory capital calculation is a structured **data + mapping + adjustment** process, usually run quarterly (and monitored more frequently).

### Step 1 – Determine scope and pull source data

* Use the **regulatory consolidation** perimeter (which may differ from pure accounting consolidation).
* Extract from the general ledger / consolidation system:

  * Share capital accounts
  * Reserves and surplus
  * Retained earnings
  * Hybrid capital accounts (PNCPS, PDIs, etc.)
  * Subordinated debt, preference shares
  * Provisions and loss reserves
  * Minority interests

### Step 2 – Map accounting items to regulatory capital categories

* Maintain a governance-approved **mapping table**:

  * GL code → CET1 / AT1 / Tier 2 / not capital

* Examples:

  * Paid-up equity capital that meets criteria → CET1
  * Securities premium on equity → CET1
  * Perpetual non-cumulative preference shares that meet AT1 criteria → AT1
  * Perpetual debt instruments meeting AT1 rules → AT1
  * Subordinated debt with ≥5 years original maturity and proper terms → Tier 2
  * General provisions on standard assets (subject to conditions) → Tier 2 (within 1.25% cap)
  * Revaluation reserves → Tier 2 (only 45% recognised)

### Step 3 – Compute gross capital amounts

* Sum balances per category to obtain:

  * **Gross CET1 before adjustments**
  * **Gross AT1 before adjustments**
  * **Gross Tier 2 before adjustments**

* Apply RBI rules on inclusion of **current-year profits** in CET1 (audited / verified, net of expected dividends and taxes, etc.).

### Step 4 – Apply regulatory adjustments

For each tier:

* Deduct **goodwill and other intangibles** from CET1.
* Deduct DTAs and certain investments according to the Basel threshold rules and RBI implementation.
* Deduct any **shortfall of provisions to expected loss** (for IRB banks) from CET1.
* Apply any **prudential filters** (e.g. on unrealised gains, hedging reserves, pension assets) as required.

Result:

* ( C_{\text{CET1}} ) – net CET1
* ( C_{\text{AT1}} ) – net AT1
* ( C_{\text{Tier2}} ) – net Tier 2

### Step 5 – Aggregate to Tier 1 and Total capital

[
C_{\text{T1}} = C_{\text{CET1}} + C_{\text{AT1}}
]

[
C_{\text{Total}} = C_{\text{T1}} + C_{\text{Tier2}}
]

Check any **caps** (e.g. Tier 2 vs Tier 1, or caps on provisions) defined by RBI/Basel.

### Step 6 – Compute capital ratios

* Take total RWA from the **RWA engine** (credit, market, operational, etc.).
* Compute:

  * CET1 ratio
  * Tier 1 ratio
  * Total capital (CRAR)
* Compare against:

  * Basel template minima, and
  * **RBI minimum + buffer** structure.

### Step 7 – Controls and governance

Typical controls include:

* Reconciliation of capital figures with published financial statements.
* Movement analysis: opening vs closing capital by component (issues, redemptions, profit retention, FX, etc.).
* Checks that new issuances actually comply with **Basel/RBI eligibility criteria** (no incentives to redeem, proper subordination, PoNV clauses, etc.).
* Internal and external review as part of ICAAP and supervisory processes.

---

## 3.8 Key points and practitioner notes

1. **Regulatory capital is not the same as “shareholders’ funds”**

   * Some items in accounting equity (e.g. intangibles, certain DTAs) are **not** accepted as high-quality capital and are removed via regulatory adjustments.

2. **Going-concern vs gone-concern is a fundamental split**

   * **Tier 1 (CET1 + AT1)** is designed to absorb losses while the bank continues to operate.
   * **Tier 2** mainly works in failure / resolution scenarios.

3. **India’s calibration is stricter than the Basel template**

   * Instead of 4.5 / 6 / 8 (CET1 / Tier 1 / Total), Indian banks face 5.5 / 7 / 9, plus a **2.5% CET1 CCB**, implying an effective total capital requirement of **11.5%** in normal conditions.

4. **Eligibility of AT1 and Tier 2 instruments is about behaviour in stress**

   * When reviewing an instrument, the central questions are:

     * Will it **remain available** in stress (no hard maturity, or long-dated with amortisation)?
     * Are payments **discretionary** (for AT1) or can they be constrained?
     * Does the instrument clearly **absorb losses** at trigger / PoNV?

5. **Provisions in capital are capped**

   * General provisions and similar buffers can be recognised in **Tier 2 only up to specified percentages of credit-risk RWA** (1.25% for standardised banks, 0.6% for certain IRB excess provisions).

Keeping these points clear makes it much easier to design, read, and explain capital structures and capital adequacy metrics.
