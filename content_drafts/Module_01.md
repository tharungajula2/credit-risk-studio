# Module 1 – Capital Adequacy: Context & Landscape

---

## 1.1 What is “capital adequacy”?

At the highest level:

* A bank **takes risk**: lending, investing, trading, providing guarantees, etc.
* Some loans will **default**, markets will move, operations will fail.
* To withstand these losses without failing, the bank needs a **loss-absorbing buffer**.

That buffer is **regulatory capital**.
“Capital adequacy” asks:

> Does the bank have **enough** regulatory capital compared to the **risk-weighted** size of its exposures?

Regulators measure this through **capital ratios**, especially:

[
\text{Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR / CRAR)}
= \frac{\text{Regulatory Capital}}{\text{Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)}}
]

* **Regulatory capital** = the parts of a bank’s funding that regulators recognise as loss-absorbing (CET1, AT1, Tier 2 – detailed in Modules 2–3).
* **RWA** = the bank’s exposures, but **adjusted for risk** (credit, market, operational, etc.).

BCBS standards (Basel I, II and III) are built around a **minimum total capital ratio of 8% of RWA**, with more detailed minimums for CET1 and Tier 1 under Basel III.

In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requires a **minimum total capital adequacy ratio of 9% of RWA**, higher than the Basel 8% benchmark.   On top of this, banks must hold a **Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) of 2.5% of RWA in CET1**, bringing the effective total capital requirement to **11.5% of RWA** once fully phased in.

> In practice, “CAR” and “CRAR” are used interchangeably for the capital-to-RWA ratio.

---

## 1.2 Why do capital adequacy rules exist?

Regulators use capital rules to achieve three main objectives.

### 1. Financial stability

Under-capitalised banks are vulnerable:

* A moderate shock can **wipe out equity**.
* This can trigger **runs**, contagion, and a broader financial crisis.

Basel III was introduced after the 2007–09 global financial crisis specifically to **strengthen the resilience** of banks by raising both the **quality and quantity** of capital and by adding capital buffers.

### 2. Protect depositors and the real economy

Most depositors **cannot independently assess** bank risk.

* Capital acts as a **shield** between depositors and unexpected losses.
* Strong capital reduces the probability that depositors or taxpayers have to absorb losses via bail-outs.

### 3. Constrain excessive risk-taking (moral hazard)

Banks fund themselves largely with **other people’s money** (deposits and wholesale funding). Without capital constraints they could:

* Take **very high risk** to maximise short-term returns.
* Rely on expected public support if things go wrong.

Higher capital requirements force banks to keep more of their **own loss-absorbing resources** at risk, reducing incentives to take excessive risk.

---

## 1.3 Who sets these rules? Global vs national regulators

### 1.3.1 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)

* The **Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)**, hosted by the **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)** in Basel, develops global standards such as **Basel I, Basel II, Basel III and the “Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms” package (Basel 3.1)**.
* These standards are **not laws** by themselves; they are **agreed benchmarks** for bank capital and risk management.

Key idea:

> Basel defines **concepts, minimum ratios and methodologies**.
> Each **national authority** decides how to adopt or **tighten** them in local regulation.

### 1.3.2 National implementation – example: India (RBI)

In India:

* The **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** is the central bank and primary prudential regulator for banks.
* RBI has implemented Basel II and Basel III through detailed **guidelines, master circulars and master directions**, including the **“Master Circular – Basel III Capital Regulations”** and related updates.
* RBI explicitly states that the **CRAR framework advocated by the Basel Accord** has been adopted for capital adequacy, covering risk on both **on-balance-sheet** and **off-balance-sheet** items.

India’s calibration is **more conservative** than the Basel template:

* Basel minimum total capital ratio: **8% of RWA**.
* RBI minimum CRAR for banks: **9% of RWA**, on an ongoing basis.
* Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB): **2.5% of RWA in CET1**, fully in place from 1 October 2021.

So, in normal conditions, the **effective minimum total capital requirement in India is 11.5% of RWA** (9% minimum + 2.5% CCB), with scope for additional buffers where relevant.

## 1.4 Where does capital adequacy sit inside the bank?

Capital adequacy is part of a wider internal ecosystem.

1. **Accounting & financial reporting**

   * Prepares the **balance sheet** and **profit & loss account** under accounting standards (e.g. Ind AS / IFRS).
   * Shows total assets, liabilities and equity – but **not risk-weighted**.

2. **Risk management**

   * Identifies and quantifies:

     * **Credit risk** – borrowers or counterparties defaulting.
     * **Market risk** – movements in interest rates, FX, equities, commodities.
     * **Operational risk** – process failures, fraud, legal and system issues.

   * Sets risk appetite, limits and measurement models.

3. **Regulatory capital / capital adequacy**

   * Uses:

     * Accounting data (on-balance and off-balance exposures).
     * Risk parameters (risk weights, credit conversion factors, etc.).

   * Produces:

     * **Regulatory capital** (CET1, AT1, Tier 2).
     * **RWA** by risk type and portfolio.
     * **Capital ratios**: CET1 ratio, Tier 1 ratio, Total capital ratio (CRAR).

   * Ensures ratios remain **above regulatory minimums plus buffers** at all times.

4. **Stress testing and capital planning**

   * Projects capital and RWA under **baseline and stressed scenarios**.
   * Checks whether the bank stays above requirements in stress.
   * Forms part of **ICAAP** (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process) under Pillar 2.

5. **Disclosures and market communication**

   * Prepares **Pillar 3 disclosures**, annual report sections and investor information.
   * Communicates capital adequacy, leverage, liquidity and key risk metrics to regulators, investors, analysts and rating agencies.

Capital adequacy therefore sits at the **intersection** of:

* Accounting (source of exposure data),
* Risk measurement (RWA),
* Strategy and business planning (capital allocation, growth decisions),
* Supervision and public disclosure.

## 1.5 Core mechanics: capital, RWA and ratios

### 1.5.1 Regulatory capital – very high level

At Basel III level, total regulatory capital can be summarised as:

[
\text{Total Capital}
= \text{CET1} + \text{AT1} + \text{Tier 2}

* \text{Regulatory Deductions}
  ]

Where:

* **CET1 (Common Equity Tier 1)** = ordinary shares and related reserves, retained earnings and other qualifying elements, net of adjustments such as goodwill and certain deferred tax assets.
* **AT1 (Additional Tier 1)** = perpetual, subordinated instruments with fully discretionary coupons and loss-absorption features.
* **Tier 2** = lower-tier capital such as dated subordinated debt and certain provisions.

Basel III emphasises both the **quality of capital** (especially CET1) and clear eligibility criteria for AT1 and Tier 2 instruments.

### 1.5.2 Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) – conceptual structure

Total RWA can be broken down as:

[
\text{Total RWA}
= \text{RWA}_{\text{Credit}}

* \text{RWA}_{\text{Market}}
* \text{RWA}_{\text{Operational}}
* \text{(other components, where applicable)}
  ]

- **Credit risk RWA** – exposures to borrowers (sovereigns, banks, corporates, retail, etc.), risk-weighted under either the **Standardised Approach (SA)** or **Internal Ratings-Based (IRB)** approaches.
- **Market risk RWA** – trading book positions exposed to market price movements.
- **Operational risk RWA** – based on size and loss experience (e.g. Standardised Measurement Approach).

Basel frameworks state that **minimum capital requirements are calculated for credit, market and operational risk**, and that minimum ratios (CET1, Tier 1, Total capital) are expressed as percentages of **total RWA**.

### 1.5.3 Capital adequacy ratios

The general form:

[
\text{Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR / CRAR)}
= \frac{\text{Total Regulatory Capital}}{\text{Total RWA}}
]

Basel III minimum levels are:

* **CET1 ratio** ≥ **4.5%** of RWA
* **Tier 1 ratio** ≥ **6.0%** of RWA
* **Total capital ratio** ≥ **8.0%** of RWA

These are supplemented by **capital buffers** (CCB, possible CCyB, systemic buffers).

In India:

* **Minimum total capital ratio (CRAR)** = **9% of RWA**.
* **Capital Conservation Buffer** = **2.5% of RWA in CET1** when fully implemented.

Detailed calibrations and buffer mechanics are developed further in later modules.

## 1.6 Regulatory environment – India-focused view

### 1.6.1 RBI’s role

RBI’s key roles relevant to capital adequacy:

* **Prudential regulator** – issues norms on capital adequacy, risk management, income recognition, asset classification and provisioning.
* **Supervisor** – conducts onsite inspections and offsite monitoring, and applies the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).
* **Monetary authority and liquidity manager** – indirectly influencing bank balance sheets and risks.

On capital adequacy specifically:

* RBI uses the **CRAR methodology** advocated by the Basel Accord, covering risk in both on- and off-balance sheet items.
* Basel III capital regulations for Indian banks began implementation from **1 April 2013**, on a phased schedule aligned with, but sometimes more conservative than, global timelines.

### 1.6.2 India vs global Basel – stricter calibration

Reasons often cited for India’s more conservative stance (e.g. 9% vs 8% minimum, and early adoption of buffers) include:

* Higher perceived **macro-financial volatility** and concentration risk in certain segments.
* Desire to maintain **strong depositor and investor confidence**.
* Need for additional safety margins during phases when data, systems or models are still evolving towards global best practice.

For analysis and implementation work, it is important to keep both layers in mind:

* The **Basel global template**; and
* The **RBI implementation**, which may impose **higher ratios or additional conditions**.

## 1.7 How are capital and RWA numbers used in practice?

### 1.7.1 Internal uses inside the bank

1. **Regulatory compliance monitoring**

   * Regular tracking of:

     * CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios,
     * Leverage ratio,
     * Position relative to CCB and any other buffers.

   * Internal triggers are set **above** regulatory minimums to provide early warning.

2. **Risk appetite and limits**

   * Board and senior management define **target capital levels** and **risk appetite** (for example, a target headroom of 1–2 percentage points above the regulatory stack).
   * Business units receive:

     * **RWA limits** by portfolio or segment, and
     * Capital-usage metrics to incorporate into planning.

3. **Business planning and product strategy**

   * Capital is treated as a **scarce resource**.
   * New products and portfolios are evaluated on both:

     * Risk profile, and
     * **Return on capital** and RWA consumption.

4. **Risk–finance integration**

   * RWA numbers are reconciled to:

     * Accounting exposures,
     * Provisioning and impairments,
     * Internal risk parameters.

   * Change analysis distinguishes between **volume effects**, **mix effects**, and **risk-parameter/CRM effects**.

### 1.7.2 External and supervisory uses

1. **Regulatory reporting and supervision**

   * Banks submit **capital adequacy and RWA returns** to the supervisor at required frequency.
   * Supervisors use these for:

     * Assessing capital adequacy,
     * Setting **Pillar 2 capital add-ons** where needed,
     * Determining any restrictions or supervisory actions.

2. **Pillar 3 disclosures and market discipline**

   * Basel III and corresponding national rules require detailed **Pillar 3 disclosures** on:

     * Capital structure and capital ratios,
     * RWA by risk type and portfolio,
     * Credit risk, CRM and securitisation exposures,
     * Leverage and other key metrics.

   * Investors, analysts and rating agencies use these disclosures to compare risk profiles and capital strength across banks.

3. **Triggers and constraints**

   * Falling into the **capital conservation buffer range** does not necessarily mean breaching minimums, but it triggers **automatic restrictions on distributions** (dividends, share buy-backs, variable remuneration) until capital is rebuilt.

---

## 1.8 Key takeaways for Module 1

**1. Capital adequacy = capital vs risk-weighted size of the balance sheet**

* Numerator: **quality and quantity of regulatory capital** (CET1, AT1, Tier 2).
* Denominator: **risk-weighted assets**, combining credit, market and operational risk.
* Most practical capital actions work by either increasing capital or optimising RWA.

---

**2. Understand the regulatory “stack”**

Always distinguish between:

* **Global Basel minimums** (e.g. CET1 4.5%, Tier 1 6%, Total capital 8%).
* **RBI overlays** (e.g. **9% CRAR minimum** plus **2.5% CCB** = 11.5% effective total capital requirement).
* Any **bank-specific internal targets**, which are usually set above the regulatory minimum stack.

---

**3. RWA is not the same as total assets**

* Total assets are **accounting values**.
* RWA incorporates **risk sensitivity** via risk weights.
* Two banks of similar asset size can have **very different RWA and capital ratios**, depending on portfolio mix, collateral, ratings and CRM.

---

**4. Everything else in the course is a deeper breakdown of CAR = Capital / RWA**

Subsequent modules:

* Decompose the **capital side** (CET1, AT1, Tier 2, buffers).
* Decompose the **RWA side**:

  * Standardised Approach details,
  * Off-balance sheet items and CCFs,
  * CRM, securitisation and other risk types,
  * Data flows, reporting and planning.

Keeping the simple equation

[
\text{CAR} = \frac{\text{Capital}}{\text{RWA}}
]

in mind makes it much easier to connect each later module back to the overall picture.
